<b>Training Data Naming </b> <br>
No noise cases: <br>
SiNtrainingDintXSMY.csv <br>
X is the mode number (1 or 2)<br>
Y is the Sellmeier model number (1, 2, 3, or 4)<br>
 <br>
 
Noise added cases follow the same naming but with noise amount in the end. For example, "SiNtrainingDintSM1_50.csv" is "SiNtrainingDintSM1.csv" data + 50*random
